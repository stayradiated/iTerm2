StayRadiated's iTerm2 Mod
=========================

## Compiling

Open `iTerm.xcodeproj` in Xcode. Compile the project and then copy the
`iTerm.app` file from `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/iTerm-XXX/Build/Products/Development`.

## Custom Tabs

The main part of this mod is that it has custom tab styles.

Go to `Preferences > Appearance > Tabs`.

Settings that I use:

    # Tabs
    Tab style: Aqua
    Tab position: Bottom

    [ ] Hide tab bar when there is only one tab
    [x] Color tab labels on activity
    [x] Hide tab number and tab close button
    [x] Hide tab activity indicator
    
    # Panes
    [ ] Show per-pane title bar with split panes

    # Window
    [ ] Show border around window
    [x] Hide scrollbar and resize control
